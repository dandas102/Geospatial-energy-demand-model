# Geospatial Modelling of Energy Demands using Satellite Imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE)
This workd demonstrate the power of cloud based open-access platforms for modelling community energy demands. Due to Google Earth Engine (GEE) free computing resource limits, we perform satellite imagery selection, and minor preprocessing in the GEE code eEditor (javascript) and additional processing via Python API to evade some of the GEE constratints 

The Google Earth Engine implementation can be found at: [GEE Code Editor Link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/dandas/abudu-astonU-project) or git clone: [GIT Link](https://earthengine.googlesource.com/users/dandas/abudu-astonU-project)  

# Steps:
1. Preprocess Landsat (8/9) satellite imagery by running the JavaScript file (landsat_imagery_preprocessing.js) preferably in a Google Earth Engine environment (Create an Asset Folder where the preprocessed imagery will be uploaded).
2. Setup your Earth Engine python API environment on your local machine ([click here fro guidance](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install)), and Install the geemap PyPI package which is very resourceful for successful processing and analysis stages. [Steps to follow](https://pypi.org/project/geemap/)
3. Land use land cover (LULC) classification part 1: 
4. LULC part 2
